# Vue.js Swiper Component Development Guide

This step-by-step guide outlines the development process for creating a swiper component in Vue.js. Each step is designed to build upon the previous one, allowing for incremental testing and development.

## Step 1: Set Up Project Structure

Create the following file structure:

```
/src
  /components
    /Swiper
      Swiper.vue
      SwiperSlide.vue
      Swiper.types.ts
      Swiper.style.scss
      index.ts
  /directives
    /vSwipe
      index.ts
      vSwipe.ts
      types.ts
```

## Step 2: Define Types

1. Create the types for the swipe directive in `directives/vSwipe/types.ts`
2. Create component types in `components/Swiper/Swiper.types.ts` using your predefined interfaces:
   - `SwiperProps`
   - `SwiperState`
   - Any additional helper interfaces

## Step 3: Implement Swipe Directive

1. Implement the swipe directive in `directives/vSwipe/vSwipe.ts`
2. Create and export the directive in `directives/vSwipe/index.ts`
3. Test the directive with a simple example to ensure touch events are working properly

## Step 4: Create Basic Swiper Component

1. Implement the core structure of `SwiperSlide.vue`
2. Create the basic template for `Swiper.vue` with necessary elements:
   - Container
   - Wrapper
   - Slots for slides
3. Add basic styling in `Swiper.style.scss`
4. Create the main export file in `index.ts`

## Step 5: Implement Core Sliding Functionality

1. Add state management in the Swiper component
2. Implement slide width and position calculations
3. Add the swipe directive to the wrapper
4. Implement basic transitions and slide movement logic
5. Handle `slidesPerView: 'auto'` case specifically

## Step 6: Add Boundary Detection

1. Implement logic to detect beginning and end of slides
2. Add resistance when swiping beyond boundaries
3. Implement snapback animation when releasing at boundaries
4. Emit appropriate events (`reachBeginning`, `reachEnd`)

## Step 7: Implement Slide Transition Logic

1. Create `slideTo`, `slideNext`, and `slidePrev` methods
2. Add logic to determine which slide to snap to after swiping:
   - Based on swipe velocity
   - Based on swipe distance threshold
   - Based on closest snap point
3. Implement smooth animations between slides
4. Add `slideChange` event emission

## Step 8: Add Navigation and Pagination

1. Implement navigation buttons if `navigation` prop is true
2. Create pagination dots if `pagination` prop is true
3. Connect buttons and dots to slide navigation methods
4. Apply proper styling for navigation elements

## Step 9: Implement Autoplay Functionality

1. Add autoplay logic with the specified delay
2. Handle interaction to stop autoplay when appropriate
3. Implement cleanup to prevent memory leaks
4. Ensure autoplay works correctly with loop mode

## Step 10: Add Loop Mode

1. Implement loop logic to enable infinite sliding
2. Handle edge cases when looping (first/last slides)
3. Ensure smooth transitions when looping

## Step 11: Final Refinements and Testing

1. Implement responsive behavior
2. Test on various devices and screen sizes
3. Address any edge cases:
   - Single slide
   - Varying slide widths
   - Window resize handling
4. Optimize performance by debouncing/throttling events

## Step 12: Documentation and Examples

1. Document component props, events, and methods
2. Create usage examples
3. Add demos for different configurations

## Development Approach

For efficient development of this component, I recommend:

1. **Incremental Testing**: Test each feature as you implement it
2. **Mobile-First**: Test on mobile devices early and often
3. **Visual Feedback**: Add temporary visual indicators to help debug positioning
4. **Console Logging**: Log relevant state values during development
5. **Isolate Problems**: When facing issues, create minimal test cases

By following this step-by-step approach, you'll build a solid foundation first, then add more complex features incrementally, making debugging and testing more manageable.
