## How to Contribute

### 1. Create an Issue

Before making any changes, please create an issue to discuss the proposed changes. This helps us:

- Avoid duplicate work
- Ensure the change aligns with our goals
- Plan the implementation

When creating an issue, please:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed changes
- Include any relevant screenshots or examples
- Label the issue appropriately (bug, enhancement, etc.)

### 2. Create a Pull Request

Once your issue is approved, you can create a pull request:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-name/subject
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Push your branch and create a pull request
5. Link your pull request to the related issue using the issue number

## Development Process

### Local Testing with Yalc

Before publishing your package, you can test it locally in your projects using Yalc. Yalc creates a local package store and simulates package installation, making it perfect for testing your component library in real projects.

1. Install Yalc globally:

```bash
npm install -g yalc
```

2. Build your package:

```bash
yarn build
```

3. Publish to Yalc:

```bash
yalc push
```

4. In your test project, add the package using Yalc:

```bash
yalc add @tsd/component-library
```

5. When you make changes to your component library:

```bash
yarn build
yalc push
```

6. To remove the package from your test project:

```bash
yalc remove @tsd/component-library
```

### Component Structure

Maintain the existing component structure:

- Follow the established file organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include necessary documentation
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Include unit tests
- Add Storybook stories

#### Vue Component Structure Example

```vue
<template>
  <div>Example</div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
// 1. Imports (Libraries, Components, Utils)
import { ref, computed, watch } from "vue";

// 2. Types & Interfaces (for TypeScript projects)
interface ExampleProps {
  text: string;
}

// 3. Constants (Static values, enums)
const MAX_LENGTH = 100;

// 4. Props & Emits (Props should come before state)
defineProps<ExampleProps>();
const emit = defineEmits<{
  (event: "update", value: string): void;
}>();

// 5. Composables (Reusable logic)
const { someComposableState } = useSomeComposable();

// 6. Reactive State (refs, reactive objects)
const count = ref(0);
const user = reactive({ name: "John", age: 30 });

// 7. Computed Properties (Derived state)
const doubleCount = computed(() => count.value * 2);

// 8. Watchers (For reacting to state changes)
watch(count, (newVal) => {
  console.log("Count changed:", newVal);
});

// 9. Lifecycle Hooks (Mounting, cleanup, etc.)
onMounted(() => {
  console.log("Component Mounted");
});

// 10. Methods (Event handlers, logic)
function increment() {
  console.log("Method Example");
}
</script>
<style lang="scss" scoped src="<filepath>"></style>
```

## Quality Checks

Before submitting your pull request, please ensure you've completed the following:

### 1. Build and Verify

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run build
yarn build

# Verify the build output
```

### 2. Lint Your Code

```bash
# Run linter
yarn lint
```

### 3. Test Coverage

- Aim for 100% test coverage
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  yarn test
  ```
- Check coverage report:
  ```bash
  yarn coverage
  ```
